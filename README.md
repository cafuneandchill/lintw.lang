https://web.archive.org/web/20180708121040/http://lintw.net/top.en.html

# lintw.lang

English-Lintwese converter and Lintwese Fonts.

# Converter

http://nkymtky.github.io/lintw.lang/converter.html

## How to use this converter

NOTE: To use the Python version of the converter or the dictionary viewer, it is required to install one of the fonts located in the `fonts` directory to your computer. LintwBasic 1.13 or 1.20 are recommended.

### JavaScript

```
<script src="path/to/lintw.lang.js"></script>
```

```
var word = lintw.lang.getWord("water");
console.log(word.lintwese + " [" +word.latin + "]");
```

### Python

Run `python_version/converter.py` in a Python environment (executables or shell scripts are not implemented yet).

# Lintwian Dictionary Viewer

Besides the English-Lintwian converter/translator, there are also files for the Lintwian dictionary viewer included in this repository. The viewer is still in the works, so it may not work properly or work at all.

## How to use the dictionary viewer

Run `python_version/lintwDictViewer` in the same way as the converter itself.
